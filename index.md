<aside>
<blockquote>
"Once in a great while someone makes an automobile that is a thing apart from all others, 
an impersonal machine possessing a definite personality...<br>
...many a man competent to know will argue
that the most completely appealing
and unforgettable personality ever built into a car
was put into the smallest of them all:
The MG Midget."
