30 of these cars were made in 1930-32. They were designed by Fred Stiles with coachwork by James Young of Bromley.

There are only 5 known to exist with the original body/chassis combination and this is the only one in North America.

We have complete documentation of all the previous owners, including the first, Dr. Frankis Tilney Evans who presented it to his wife on her birthday in May of 1932.

The color combinations are original and verified by the paint found on the body and chassis and in the Stiles Company Sales brochure.
