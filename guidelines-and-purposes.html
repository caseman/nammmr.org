<h2 class="divider">The North American Triple-M Register</h2>

<p><em>Please find the following new member/prospect information and guidelines
for what constitutes an acceptable car under the Register.</em></p>

<ol class="top">
    <li>
        <h3>PURPOSE</h3> 
        <p>The North American Triple-M Register (The Register) is affiliated
        with the MG Car Club Ltd. (MGCC) Triple-M Register which caters for
        the overhead-camshaft Midget, Magna and Magnette models built between
        1929 and 1936, hence Triple-M.</p>
        <p>The objectives of the Register are:</p>
        <ol>
           <li>To maintain a register ('The Register Listing') of surviving Triple-M cars, recording their history other relevant information;</li>
            <li>To encourage the restoration, maintenance and continuing use of Triple-M cars both on the road and competition;</li>
            <li>To preserve the heritage of MG Triple-M cars and promote MG as "THE MARK OF FRIENDSHIP" throughout North America.</li>
            <li>To organize and assist others in organizing competitive and social events;</li>
            <li>To provide technical advice, and encourage the exchange of spare parts;</li>
            <li>To publish a quarterly Newsletter;</li>
            <li>To organize and conduct an annual meet, and to participate in the quintennial All-MG Meet by the North American Council of MG Registers;</li>
            <li>To maintain a web-site dedicated to Triple-M matters.</li>
            <li>To co-operate with like minded Clubs, including the North American Council of MG Registers and enthusiasts with the aim of fulfilling the objectives of the Register.</li>
        </ol>
    </li><li>
        <h3>OPERATION & MAINTENANCE OF THE REGISTER DIRECTORY</h3>
        <p>The Register Directory is a compilation of information kept for the Register's own purposes. It is maintained and published for general information only and does not confer authenticity. The list includes surviving complete cars and cars that contain only some components originally supplied by the MG Car Company. The inclusion or exclusion of any particular car or specification is at the sole discretion of The Register Committee (the Committee). Although care is taken in accepting cars for inclusion in the Directory it is not possible to scrutinize every entry, nor is it possible to verify the accuracy or authenticity of the information the Register receives to compile and update the Directory.</p>
        <p>Neither the Committee, nor the MGCC accept any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or authenticity of the information in the Directory.</p>
        <p>Details of any Triple-M car to be added to the Register Directory, or the updating of information on a car already registered, should be submitted in writing to the Registrar using the 'Triple-M Registration and Update Form'. This form can be completed by downloading the form and posting or emailing it to the Registrar. The form is also supplied with the Register "Starter Pack" given to new members. It can also be obtained from the Registrar.</p>
        <p>When a qualifying Triple-M car is first accepted for inclusion in the Register Listing it is assessed under the Guidelines detailed in Section 3 below. If the car qualifies under section 3.2 it will be allocated a formal Triple-M Register number as issued by the MG Car Club Triple-M Register. That number then remains with the car permanently, regardless of any future change of ownership. No charge is made for adding a car to the Register Directory.</p>
        <p>Cars (or parts of cars) which do not qualify for the allocation of a Register Number will be entered into the Register Listing provided that in other respects they satisfy the criteria in section 3.1.  Copies of these guidelines can be obtained by downloading from the above web-site or from the Registrar.</p>
        <p>All would-be purchasers of a Triple-M car and/or those wishing to deal in them are advised to familiarize themselves with the conditions under which cars may be included or excluded from the Register Listing as well as the purpose, operation and maintenance of the Register Directory as set forth in these guidelines.</p> 
    </li><li>
        <h3>TRIPLE-M REGISTER REGISTRATION AND REGISTER NUMBER ALLOCATION</h3>
        <p>As the North American Triple-M Register operates as an extension of the MG Car Club Triple-M Register and identifies North American member cars using the MGCC register numbers, the following guidelines are those of the MG Car Club Triple-M Register, but apply equally to the member cars of the North American Triple-M Register.</p>
        <p>The term "Register Listing" refers to the MGCC Triple-M Register printed listing of Triple-M cars which is a super set of the North American Triple-M Register Directory. The guidelines are the same for both Registers.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Guidelines for Register Listing
                <p>Definitions.</p>
                <p>For the purposes of these Guidelines:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>'Original Triple-M chassis'</dt>
                    <dd>means an original unaltered chassis in the form in which it left the M.G.  Works at the time and place of its original manufacture and including its original front dumb iron (knuckle);<dd>
                    <dt>'Altered Chassis'</dt>
                    <dd>means an Original Triple-M chassis that has been either shortened or lengthened;</dd>
                    <dt>'Reconstructed Chassis'</dt> 
                    <dd>means a chassis that is based on an Original Triple-M chassis that has had some of its elements replaced with reproduction or non-original parts. e.g. if the side rails or the cross tubes or the castings are replacement parts;</dd>
                    <dt>'New Chassis'</dt>
                    <dd>means a reproduction chassis i.e. a chassis that did not emanate from the M.G. Works;</dd>
                    <dt>'Front dumb iron'</dt>
                    <dd>means the forged steel component at the forward end of a Triple-M chassis which locates the forward eye of the front leaf spring and (where fitted) a chassis cross tube;</dd>
                    <dt>'Knuckle'</dt>
                    <dd>has the same meaning as 'Front dumb-iron';</dd>
                    <dt>'Original front knuckle'</dt>
                    <dd>means the front dumb-iron originally incorporated into the construction of an original Triple-M chassis;</dd>
                    <dt>'Original chassis number'</dt>
                    <dd>means the identifying number of an original Triple-M chassis evidenced by the letter(s) and numerals stamped on an original front knuckle at the time of manufacture. Note: most such numbers will be found on the right hand side (driver's side) knuckle, although certain chassis, including some of those exported from the works are known to have been stamped on the left hand side (passenger's side) knuckle;</dd>
                    <dt>'A Triple-M Car'</dt>
                    <dd>where the context permits means a car built on an original Triple-M chassis which is complete, roadworthy and with its major components or modern replacement components manufactured to original Triple-M specification;</dd>
                    <dt>'The Register Listing'</dt>
                    <dd>has the meaning set out in paragraph 1.1 of this document;</dd>
                    <dt>'The M.G. Works'</dt>
                    <dd>means the factory(ies) of the M.G. Car Company</dd>
                </dl>
                <p>The original chassis number as defined in these Guidelines is used by the Register as the car's Primary
    Identity Indicator. Before a car is included in the Register Listing it must qualify under one of the
    following criteria:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A car built on an original Triple-M chassis containing an original front knuckle clearly stamped with its original chassis number as defined above will be included in the Register Listing under that number.</li>
                    <li>A car built on an original Triple-M chassis which has an original dumb-iron (knuckle) but does not clearly show its original chassis number will be listed under chassis number “A ????” where “A” is the model letter designation for the chassis used, unless the original chassis serial number can be established beyond reasonable doubt (see 3.1.4 below).</li>
                    <li>A car that has a history that shows there was more than one MG Works supplied chassis for the same chassis number, will be listed under that chassis number if it is based on the original/first chassis or, in the case of a car based on the factory replacement/second chassis, with that chassis number and the suffix ”/2”.</li>
                    <li>A car built on an original Triple-M chassis which does not clearly show its original chassis number but has sufficient physical or documentary evidence to link it to an original number, will be listed under that number unless it is later proved otherwise.</li>
                    <li>A car built on an altered chassis but having its original front knuckle clearly showing its original number, will be listed under that number with the note “altered chassis”.</li>
                    <li>A car built on a reconstructed chassis but having its original front knuckle clearly showing its original number, will be listed under that number with the note “reconstructed chassis”.</li>
                    <li>A car built on a new chassis but having an original front knuckle clearly showing its original chassis number, will be listed under that number with the note “new chassis”.</li>
                    <li>A car built on an original Triple-M chassis, incorporating a collection of Triple-M components manufactured to their original specification, which is not covered by any of the above criteria may be included in the Register Listing at the discretion of the Committee.</li>
                    <li>A complete original chassis clearly showing its original chassis number will be listed in the Register under that chassis number with the note “chassis only”.  In operating these guidelines the Committee will have regard to factors that may, in varying degrees, affect its judgment about a particular chassis or car. These factors include the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The completeness, originality or integrity of the main components of a chassis, including its castings, side or other rails and tubes;</li>
                            <li>Factual evidence of past damage or destruction of a chassis or its major components;</li>
                            <li>Factual evidence of the replacement of damaged or destroyed chassis components with period or modern replacements;</li>
                            <li>Factual evidence of the defacing and re-stamping of a front dumb-iron (knuckle);</li>
                            <li>The M.G. Works guarantee plate and its stampings;</li>
                            <li>The M.G. Works stamping of the bonnet hinge.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li><li>
                Guidelines for the Allocation of Register Numbers
                <ol>
                    <li>A Triple-M Register Number will be allocated to the following Register entries:
                        <ol>
                            <li>A Triple-M car which is complete, roadworthy and consists of all original Triple-M components;</li>
                            <li>A Triple-M car which is essentially complete with its original chassis and original Triple-M components whether roadworthy, under restoration or dismantled in storage;</li>
                            <li>A Triple-M car which is essentially complete with its original chassis but includes some reproduction Triple-M components, whether roadworthy, under restoration or dismantled in storage;</li>
                            <li>A Triple-M car which is essentially complete with its original chassis but includes some components not originally fitted to Triple-M cars (e.g. XPAG engine, Armstrong pre-selector gearbox), whether roadworthy, under restoration or dismantled in storage. If the Registrar considers that the proportion or type of non-original components is excessive, the application will be referred to the Committee. At the Committee's discretion such a car may be denied a Register Number;</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>A Triple-M Register Number will not be allocated to the following:
                        <ol>
                            <li>A Triple-M car built on a reproduction chassis without an original identity.</li>
                            <li>A Triple-M car that displays a chassis number that is not correct for its chassis type (original or reproduction).</li>
                            <li>A Triple-M “chassis only” entry or an entry where a number of major components are lacking e.g. a car without a body or one without a drive train. As soon as the details for such an entry indicate that the package represents an essentially complete car, the provisions of section 3.2.1 above will apply.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>

        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <p>A Triple-M Register Number always stays with the chassis on which the car was built when the Number was first allocated. It is not transferable.</p>
        <p>In cases where there is ambiguity about the true identity of a car, the Committee reserves the right to include that car in the Register listing on a provisional basis pending the receipt of definitive evidence concerning that car. The Committee may likewise withdraw or suspend a Register Number if a car is found to contravene these guidelines.</p>
        <p>Any member of the M.G. Car Company Club Ltd. who is the owner of a listed Triple-M car may discuss the classification of their car with the Committee.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li><li>
        <h3>TRIPLE-M MGs - SPECIALS AND NON STANDARD CARS</h3>
        <p>How the Register describes cars that are not built to their original specification.</p>
        <p>This guidance will be used by the officials of the Register in response to enquiries, or in commenting upon issues, regarding the proper description of specials and non-standard cars constructed on Triple-M chassis.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The Register does not recognize the description 'Replica' when applied to any Triple-M car other than the factory produced M 12/12 Replicas;</li>
            <li>A car built in the style of one car but on the chassis of another will be described as the chassis type on which it is built. For example, a C type copy built on a D type chassis will be described as a D type. Likewise, a car built in the style of a J4 on a J2 chassis will be described as a J2. The same applies to a car built in the style of a Q type, K3 or NE;</li>
            <li>A Triple-M car fitted with a non-standard Triple-M engine (for the model) will be described as such. For instance, a J2 chassis fitted with a PB engine will be described as a J2-PB. Furthermore if the engine is supercharged it will be described as J2-PB/s;</li>
            <li>The Register is not opposed to the term 'special' if a car is fitted with a non-standard body (for chassis), but it will be described as the chassis type on which it is built. For example, a single seat body fitted on an N type chassis will be described as an N type special;</li>
            <li>The Register does not recognize a car described as J2/J4 or K1/K3 or P/Q etc. as it implies that some main parts of the car are genuine J4, K3 or Q type etc. when they are not;</li>
            <li>In former years it was common practice for constructors or designers to incorporate their name in the description of a special, e.g. Bellevue Special, Turner MG. Some specials were given names by their owners, e.g. 'Bongazoo'. The Register has no objection to these descriptions still being used.</li>
        </ol>
    </li><li>
        <h3>COMPETITION RULES</h3>
        <p>The rules governing Register competition awards can be obtained from the Competition Secretary or found in the competition section of the Triple-M website. Inclusion of a car in the published Register Listing does not confer automatic eligibility for Register awards.</p>
    </li><li>
        <h3>ENGINES AND CYLINDER BLOCKS</h3>
        <p>For various reasons it may become necessary:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>to replace a car's original engine with another unit derived from another Triple-M car. </li>
            <li>to substitute an original cylinder block with a newly-manufactured replacement block.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Whenever these changes occur, the Register asks owners to ensure that details of the change are notified to the Registrar.</p>
        <p>It is the Register's policy that whenever a newly-manufactured cylinder block is utilized, it should be stamped with an identifying number followed by the suffix "/2". The identifying number should be one that that is appropriate to that particular vehicle. If the new block is of the same type as that of the engine originally installed in that car at the time of manufacture, it will be in order to use the original engine's number. Alternatively if the new block replaces an engine that was not original to that car, it is permissible to use the number of the engine that is being replaced, in each case adding the suffix "/ 2" previously mentioned. The Registrar should be consulted in case of any uncertainty.</p>
    </li>
