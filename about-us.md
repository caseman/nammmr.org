<img class="float-left" src="img/nammmr-logo-metal.png" alt="">

The North American MMM Register was created in 1989 by Jerry Keuper
to provide a means of communication among owners of MMM cars in North America.

"MMM" refers to Midget, Magna and Magnette: the overhead cam MGs
produced between 1929 and 1936.

The register has circa 150 members who own (in total) over 200 cars
encompassing more than 20 different models. The register also has records of
about 250 MMM cars in North America that are currently not in the active
membership. The "N.A. MMM Annual Directory" is sent to members in good
standing.

The [NAMMMR Purpose & Guidelines document](guidelines-and-purposes)
contains Definitions and Qualifications for authentic MMM cars as recognised
by the MGCC UK, Triple-M Register and published in their Register Directory,
as well as our own.
