        <p class="date">June 7-9, 2019</p>

The MG Car Club - Rocky Mountain Centre invites you to join us for the
67th Annual Rallye Glenwood Springs, the oldest continually-held
Time-Speed-Distance Rallye in the United States, on Friday, Saturday,
and Sunday, June 7-9, 2019.

The weekend is a marvelous opportunity for sports car enthusiasts of
every marque to come together for sunny days, cool nights, and unique
events.  The fun begins on Friday with the Time-Speed-Distance Rallye,
which will take you through some beautiful scenery on the way to
Glenwood Springs.  Saturdayâ€™s main event is a more relaxed tour, with
a fun murder-mystery twist.

To celebrate 90 years of MG sports cars, this year's featured MG model is the
original M Type Midget. We are expecting a number of MMM cars to be present
for this year's car show.

For more information, and to register, visit the
<a href="https://mgcc.org/rallye-glenwood-springs/">Rallye Glenwood Springs page</a> 
on the MGCC website.
